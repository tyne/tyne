module Extensions
  # Contains logic for issue extensions
  module Issues
    # Defines a basic workflow for issues
    # The workflow is as follows:
    # ---
    # default_state: open
    # ---
    # open or reopened -> wip
    # open or reopened or wip -> done
    # open or reopened or wip -> invalid
    # wip -> open
    # done or invalid -> reopened
